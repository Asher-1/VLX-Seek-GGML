# Idempotent ggml patch replay for the VLX-Seek integration.
#
# Contract (mirrors ultralytics-ggml section 9):
#   * exactly the patches under third_party/ggml-patches/ are applied, in
#     lexical order, against the pinned submodule checkout;
#   * the stamp file records the patch set; any change invalidates it;
#   * a stamp that is older than a patched file is also invalidated, so a
#     partial manual edit can never be mistaken for a successful replay.
